# Formula thoughts/brainstorming/ideas

Multiple expressions are plotted separately; so this is two lines on one graph:
    y = x^2
    y = x*(0.5*x)+3

Set properties; obvious properties shouldn't need explicit identification:
    y{color:green} = x^2
    y{red} = x*(0.5*x)+3

Assign names to axis:
    x:xname, y:yname
    yname{green} = xname^2
    yname{red} = xname * (0.5 * xname) + 3

I should be able to treat dates as normal text - it's just a category for data.

## Cell references

@@          : entire table
@A1         : value at cell A1
@A          : values at col A, abstract over rows
@1          : values at row 1, abstract over cols
@A[1-10]    : values at col A, abstract over rows 1 through 10
@[A-D]5     : values at row 5, abstract over cols A through D
@[A-D][2-10]:


# Formula specification

## Notes

Commas are throw-away; they have no semantic meaning and exist for the reader,
so there's no reason to care about them / enforce any constraints within a
number. "234,.2,2," is a valid number equivalent to "234.22". No comma prefixes though

Variable names are case-insensitive.

## Specification

comma             <== ,
letter            <== [a..zA..Z]
digit             <== [0..9]
integer           <== [+|-]digit{comma | digit}
double            <== [+|-]digit{comma | digit}.{comma | digit}
expression        <== op-expression | integer | double | variable
binop-expression  <== sum-expression | sub-expression
sum-expression    <== expression + expression
sub-expression    <== expression - expression
variable          <== letter{letter}
